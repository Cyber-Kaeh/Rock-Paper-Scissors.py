# Rock-Paper-Scissors.py
My client/server rock, paper, scissors game I created for my final project in the Python class I just completed.<br>
This program is complete and fully functional but I would like to add more features and continue to improve upon it. Right now there is a server program that allows a client program to connect to it on a local network so the client can play rock, paper, scissors against the computer.<br>
I wanted to make these improvements, in my own time even though the class is over and the project turned in and I am also new to GitHub so this seemed like a great opportunity for me to practice with GitHub and work on my program. Feel free to reach out with any suggestions, hints, tips, for... well pretty much anything IT related.<br>

Possible improvements:
<ol>
  <li>Multiplayer (client vs. client)</li>
  <li>Win/loss record. Displayed on both the server and client GUIs</li>
  <li>Revamp client GUI to have a login page then transition to game page</li>
  <li>Package the program to be installed on different computers/OS</li>
</ol>
